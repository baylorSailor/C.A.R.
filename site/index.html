    <p>Car Aggregate Reformed, or C.A.R. for short, is a car rental app that allows you to quickly and easily rent any vehicle your heart desires...seriously, any vehicle! Going camping for an extended weekend and need the room and utility of a truck or SUV? We have you covered! Think renting a limo for prom is tired and overplayed? Why not show up in a custom Lamborghini instead!? How funny would it be to ironically drive a cement truck to school? Rent one of ours and find out! The C.A.R. app has all your vehicle rental needs covered.</p>

    <p>This site is where we host files and provide information for the status of our app as it is in development. Code and relevant files can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/baylorSailor/C.A.R.">here</a> or downloaded in their entirety <a href="https://github.com/baylorSailor/C.A.R./archive/master.zip" download> <button type="button" class="btn btn-indigo but-lg" style="float:inherit;"> Download Zip </button> </a>
